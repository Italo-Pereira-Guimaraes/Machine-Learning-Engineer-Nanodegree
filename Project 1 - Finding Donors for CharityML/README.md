## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML
### Project Overview

In this project, supervised learning techniques were applied to the data collected by the United States census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity) identify those most likely to donate to their cause. First, an exploration is done to know how the census data is recorded. Then a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques are applied to manipulate the data and organize them into a format with which it is possible to work. Then, several models of supervised learning about the data are evaluated to determine which is best suited for the solution. After that, you'll optimize the template you previously selected that will be presented as a solution to CharityML. Finally, the chosen model and its predictions are explored underneath the cloths to evaluate its performance considering the available data.

This project is part of Udacity's machine learning nanodegree program, If you are interested in seeing the project proposal, look in the 'projects / finding_donors' directory in this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/br-machine-learning.git).

### Install Software Dependencies

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Project 1 - Finding Donors for CharityML/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser, Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
