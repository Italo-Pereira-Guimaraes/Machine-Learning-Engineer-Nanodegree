# Dermatologist AI

## Introduction

In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed capable of visually diagnosing [melanoma](http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/melanoma), the deadliest form of skin cancer. In particular, the algorithm is able to distinguish this malignant tumor and two types of benign skin lesions ([nevi](http://missinglink.ucsf.edu/lm/dermatologyglossary/nevus.html) and [seborrheic keratoses](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/bumps-and-growths/seborrheic-keratoses)).

The data and objective are pulled from the [2017 ISIC Challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection](https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/583f126bcad3a51cc66c8d9a).  As part of the challenge, participants were tasked to design an algorithm to diagnose skin lesion images as one of three different skin diseases (melanoma, nevus, or seborrheic keratosis).  In this project, you will create a model to generate your own predictions.

## Evaluation

Inspired by the ISIC challenge, the algorithm was evaluated according to three separate categories.

#### Category 1: ROC AUC for Melanoma Classification

In the first category, CNN's ability to distinguish between malignant melanoma and benign cutaneous lesions (nevus, seborrheic keratosis) was calculated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ([ROC AUC](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html)) corresponding to this binary classification task.

If you are unfamiliar with ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and would like to learn more, you can check out the documentation in [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-roc-py) or read [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic).

The top scores (from the ISIC competition) in this category can be found in the image below.

![Category 1 Rankings][image2]

#### Category 2: ROC AUC for Melanocytic Classification

All of the skin lesions that we will examine are caused by abnormal growth of either [melanocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte) or [keratinocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte), which are two different types of epidermal skin cells.  Melanomas and nevi are derived from melanocytes, whereas seborrheic keratoses are derived from keratinocytes. 

In the second category, the ability of CNN to distinguish between melanocytic and keratinocytic skin lesions was calculated by calculating the area under the ROC curve ([ROC AUC](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html)) corresponding to this binary classification task.

The top scores in this category (from the ISIC competition) can be found in the image below.

![Category 2 Rankings][image3]

#### Category 3: Mean ROC AUC

In the third category, the mean ROC AUC values of the first two categories were calculated.

The top scores in this category (from the ISIC competition) can be found in the image below.

## Getting your Results

The [**sample_predictions**](sample_predictions.csv) file stores the test predictions, each row corresponds to a different test image, in addition to a header row.

The file has exactly 3 columns:
- `Id` - the file names of the test images (in the **same** order as the sample submission file)
- `task_1` - the model's predicted probability that the image (at the path in `Id`) depicts melanoma
- `task_2` - the model's predicted probability that the image (at the path in `Id`) depicts seborrheic keratosis

To set up the environment to run this file, you need to create (and activate) an environment with Python 3.5 and a few pip-installable packages:
```text
conda create --name derm-ai python=3.5
source activate derm-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The `get_results.py` script will be used to evaluate your submission.
Once you have set up the environment, run the following command to see how the sample submission performed:
```text
python get_results.py sample_predictions.csv
```

Check the terminal output for the scores obtained in the three categories:
```text
Category 1 Score: 0.526
Category 2 Score: 0.606
Category 3 Score: 0.566
```

The corresponding **ROC curves** appear in a pop-up window, along with the **confusion matrix** corresponding to melanoma classification.  

![Sample ROC curve][image5]
![Sample confusion matrix][image6]

The code for generating the confusion matrix assumes that the threshold for classifying melanoma is set to 0.5.  To change this threshold, you need only supply an additional command-line argument when calling the `get_results.py` file.  For instance, to set the threshold at 0.4, you need only run:
```text
python get_results.py sample_predictions.csv 0.4
```
